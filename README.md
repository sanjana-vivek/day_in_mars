Today on Mars
'Today on Mars' is a cross-platform desktop application that fetches the latest images and data from the Curiosity Rover for a particular date using NASA's open API. The objective was to develop a desktop application with a user-friendly interface, allowing users to easily navigate and explore Curiosity Rover's latest images and data. 

The "Today in Mars" project leverages two essential components to provide real-time access to Curiosity Rover's images and data:
1. PySimpleGUI: A Python framework known for creating user-friendly graphical user interfaces (GUIs). PySimpleGUI facilitates an intuitive experience for browsing Curiosity's images and data, ensuring a seamless interaction for users.
2. urllib3 Module: A Python module simplifying the process of making HTTP requests to the NASA API. This module allows the application to fetch the latest images and data from the Curiosity Rover, forming the backbone of the real-time data retrieval process.

Known limitations:
- The project focuses specifically on the Curiosity Rover and its Mars Science Laboratory mission, excluding data from other Mars exploration missions.
- The application's functionality is limited to accessing and presenting images and data captured by Curiosity; it does not involve in-depth image analysis or scientific processing.
- Dependency on NASA API: The application's functionality is dependent on the availability and reliability of the NASA API. Any disruptions or changes to the API structure could impact the project's performance.

This project effectively addresses the pressing need for a user-friendly and accessible platform dedicated to exploring the latest images and data from NASA's Curiosity Rover. By integrating PySimpleGUI and the urllib3 module, the project has successfully developed a desktop application that not only simplifies data access but also enhances the overall user experience.
